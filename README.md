# Project: Todolist

Todolist is a project aimed at creating a simple to-do list application. It consists of two main components: a server component for managing data using JSON Server and a client-side component built with React.

## Project Setup

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the `to-do-list` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd to-do-list
   ```

## Server Component (database) Setup

- Navigate to the `database` directory within the cloned repository:
  ```
  cd database
  ```
- Install dependencies using npm:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the JSON Server:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  This will start the JSON Server on port 3002 and watch for changes in the `database.json` file.

## Client-Side Component (todo-list) Setup

- Navigate to the `todo-list` directory within the cloned repository:
  ```
  cd todo-list
  ```
- Install dependencies using npm:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the development server for the React application:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  This will start the React application.

## Accessing the Application

- Once both the server and client components are set up and running, you can access the to-do list application in your web browser.

- Open your preferred web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you have successfully set up the todolist project and can start using the to-do list application.
